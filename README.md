Hi there 👋 I'm Philippe Mugisha — Python Engineer & AI Practitioner 👑

I build intelligent, full-stack applications with a sharp focus on AI model training, real-world problem solving, and clean, scalable code. My work sits at the intersection of software engineering and applied machine learning—especially using Transformer-based architectures to solve challenges in agriculture, logistics, and user experience.

🧠 What I Focus On
AI/ML Engineering: Training and fine-tuning models (especially Transformers) for domain-specific tasks—like crop disease detection, market forecasting, and conversational AI for farmers.
Full-Stack Development: Building end-to-end systems with Python (Django, Flask) on the backend and React/Node.js on the frontend.
Data-Driven Applications: Integrating AI with real-time data pipelines, IoT, and user-centric interfaces.

🛠️ Core Stack
Languages: Python (primary), JavaScript, SQL, C++
AI/ML: Transformer models, scikit-learn, Hugging Face ecosystem, data preprocessing & validation
Backend: Django (with PostgreSQL), REST APIs, OAuth, environment-based config
Frontend: React, Tailwind, Next Js, responsive & accessible UIs
DevOps: Docker, CI/CD, Git, Linux/Windows/macOS
Design: Figma, Adobe, UI/UX principles — because great tech should feel great too

🔍 Current Work
Advancing AgriTech Harvest Hub: An AI-augmented platform helping smallholder farmers optimize yield and market access.
Refining AvocadoAI: A context-aware assistant delivering agronomic advice via natural language.

🌱 Open to Collaborate On
Practical AI projects (especially in agriculture, sustainability, or emerging markets)
Full-stack applications where AI enhances user value—not just for show
Clean, maintainable open-source tools in the Python & Django ecosystem
